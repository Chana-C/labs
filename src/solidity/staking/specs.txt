STAKING SPECS:

A smart contract holds 1000000 tokens. From the day of its activation, anyone can deposit anything in it
Money he wants and lock the money for 7 days, his money cannot be withdrawn. After 7 days, the money depositor must withdraw his money and return the prize he deserves according to the amount he deposited in relation to all deposits.
The prize is calculated as follows:
On the withdrawal day (after 7 days have passed) the depositor will receive a prize - money:
    The number of percentages that is the amount deposited of all deposits when withdrawing the money
from the total consideration.

Total consideration:
3% of the million (or what is left of it after people have deposited Okiblo the reward they deserve) contract tokens are held as a reward to reward the depositors.

Calculation of the reward:
The percentage of the depositor's bet is what the depositor's total * total consideration.
